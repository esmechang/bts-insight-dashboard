# bts-insight-dashboard

I built an AI-powered dashboard that analyzes emotional themes in BTS lyrics and fan comments across platforms. Using GPT-4, I extracted and structured sentiment metadata, then indexed the enriched content into Elasticsearch and visualized trends in Kibana.

The project highlights my skills in:

- Prompt engineering for emotional classification
- Structuring unstructured text for search and analysis
- Designing clear, engaging visualizations from qualitative data

This was a way to merge my technical skills with creative content, fandom culture, and real-world use cases for content teams. It also reflects how I approach human-centric prompt development and insight discovery through automation.
